title=Wild Safe Houses
description=Have you ever wanted to build your own base, and enjoy the benifits of having a safe house at the same time?  Well now you can!
description=
description=Wild Safe Houses now supports owning multiple Safe House locations!
description=
description=*** IMPORTANT INFO ***
description=Server admin's must disable the anti-cheat type 19 for this mod to function!
description=anti-cheats can be managed in the 'server options' in the admin panel in game.
description=
description=With Wild Safe Houses you can setup a safe house anywhere you like!  There are of course a few restrictions......
description=
description=   - This mod is for multiplayer servers only.  Installing this into a solo game will not function properly
description=   - Currently wild safe houses are 31 x 31 squares in size, centered on the player building the safehouse
description=   - A safe house can not be setup ontop of an existing building (not player made buildings, the ones defined by the map)
description=   - They can not overlap with a road type square of any kind!  We don't want to have highways blocked by players!
description=   - Safe houses can not be setup ontop of another safehouse.
description=   - There is a five(5) square buffer between any new safehouse location and the above restrictions to hopefully prevent any greefing
description=
description=If you can not build a safe house in your current location the tool top should tell you why.
description=
description=Wild safe houses should function as any other normal safehouse once they are placed down.
description=
description=
description=Known Issues:
description=   - I suspect that player made 'roads' will prevent creating a wild safe house, be careful if you decide to disband your safehouse with these roads inside them.
description=   - in some situations two 'claim safehouse' options appear in the context menu, one being disabled (red) and the other enabled.
description=
description=Future plans:
description=
description=   - Allow the size, buffer zone, maximum number of safe houses  and 'days alive' options to be edited by admins in the sandbox options menu.
